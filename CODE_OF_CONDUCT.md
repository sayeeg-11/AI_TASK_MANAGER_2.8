### 1. Be Respectful & Polite

Everyone—regardless of background, experience level, or opinion—deserves to be treated with kindness and professionalism. Avoid personal attacks and focus discussions on ideas, not individuals. Disagreements are natural but should remain constructive.

Experienced members are encouraged to guide and support new contributors. Provide clear and patient explanations, welcome questions, and assume good intentions. A friendly community helps the project grow and thrive.

### 3. No Spam or Harassment

Harassment, discrimination, insults, personal attacks, and inappropriate behavior are strictly prohibited. Avoid posting spam, irrelevant content, or excessive self-promotion in any project channels.

### 4. Enforcement and Consequences

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. Violations will be reviewed and may result in:

* A warning
* Temporary suspension from discussions or contributions
* Permanent removal from the project's repositories and communication channels

The severity of the action depends on the nature of the violation.
